Create and test an HTML document that describes nested ordered lists of cars. The outer list must have three entries: compact, midsize, and sports. Inside each of these three lists there must be two sublists of body styles. The compact- and midsize-car sublists are two door and four door; the sports-car sublists are coupe and convertible. Each body-style sublist must have at least three entries, each of which is the make and model of a particular car that fits the category. The outer list must use uppercase Roman numerals, the middle lists must use uppercase letters, and the inner lists must use Arabic numerals. The background color for the compact-car list must be pink; for the midsize-car list, it must be blue; for the sports-car list, it must be red. All the styles must be in a document style sheet.  Put all style-sheet information in an external style sheet.

After creating, testing, and validating the HTML5 and CSS documents, publish them on your document root on the server.  Then submit the URLs with your documents as attachments in the Cougar Course by 4:00 pm on the due day.
